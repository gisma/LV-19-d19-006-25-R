# S3 — Structural Space

## Purpose
Derive spatial structure from feature spaces.

The goal is to transform continuous feature fields into discrete, interpretable spatial objects.

## Typical Inputs
- Feature stacks
- Derived indicators

## Typical Outputs
- Segments
- Strata
- Representative spatial units
- Candidate regions

## Abstraction
Continuous space → Discrete spatial structure

## Gains
- Comparability
- Sampling logic
- Structural interpretability

## Losses
- Internal heterogeneity
- Boundary uncertainty
- Small-scale variability

## Current Reference Scripts
- 03-0_analysis_base-segmentation_otb.R
- 03-3_analysis_physio-strata-burgwald.R

## Not in Scope
- Final site selection
- Optimisation logic
