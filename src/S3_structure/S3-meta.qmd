# S3: Segmentation and structural spatial units  
Burgwald decision stack: meta-level description

![](îmages/s3.drawio.svg){fig-align="center"}

## Conceptual position of S3

S3 denotes the layer in which spatially explicit raster information is
transformed into discrete spatial units. These units are not semantic objects
in the domain sense, but operational structural entities that define coherent
spatial supports for subsequent aggregation, attribution, and decision logic.

S3 introduces explicit spatial partitioning. Continuous pixel fields are
converted into labelled regions that are internally homogeneous with respect
to a selected feature space. The segmentation itself is treated as a structural
representation, not as an interpretation of physical or ecological objects.

S3 addresses the following question:

> How can continuous spatial variability be partitioned into reproducible,
> spatially coherent units that serve as stable carriers for further analysis?

This layer formalises spatial structure without assigning meaning.

## Boundary conditions: what S3 explicitly excludes

S3 does not contain derived physical predictors, classifications, or
observational summaries. These belong to S2. It does not contain semantic
descriptors, signatures, or aggregated metrics; these belong to S4. It does not
contain learned representations or embeddings, which are assigned to S4L. It
does not contain ranking, optimisation, or decision logic, which belong to S5.

S3 units are not assumed to correspond to real-world entities such as stands,
patches, or management units. Any such interpretation is intentionally deferred
to higher layers.

Whenever a product assigns semantic meaning, aggregates attributes, or supports
explicit decisions, it has left the S3 domain.

## Functional role of S3 in the decision stack

S3 fulfils three structural functions.

First, it provides a stable spatial support for aggregation. Many quantities of
interest cannot be meaningfully interpreted at the pixel scale alone. S3 units
define spatial containers over which deterministic signatures and statistics
can later be computed without introducing arbitrary neighbourhood definitions.

Second, S3 externalises spatial boundary formation. Instead of relying on
implicit human delineation or ad-hoc buffering, spatial coherence is defined by
an explicit, reproducible segmentation process. This reduces subjective bias
and improves auditability.

Third, S3 provides a geometric scaffold for auxiliary processes. Segments may be
used as annotation infrastructure, for example to stabilise training region
delineation for pixel-based models. In this role, segments carry geometry but no
semantics.

In the Burgwald implementation, segments are also used as *grouping units* to
control spatial leakage in model assessment (e.g. spatial CV folds grouped by
segment_id). This is a methodological control use of structure, not a semantic
interpretation of the segments.

## Construction principles

S3 segmentation is derived exclusively from S2 feature layers. The segmentation
algorithm operates in a transformed feature s![](images/s2.drawio.svg){fig-align="center"}pace to reduce redundancy and
improve numerical stability. Dimensionality reduction and standardisation are
treated as technical preprocessing steps, not as semantic modelling.

Segmentation parameters are not interpreted as physical process scales. Instead,
parameter selection is treated as an operational control problem and evaluated
via stability under controlled perturbations. Robustness is prioritised over
interpretability of individual parameters.

Post-conditions are applied explicitly to enforce structural constraints on the
resulting segmentation, such as minimum region size and topological consistency.
These constraints are pragmatic and do not imply physical meaning.

The final product of S3 is a polygon layer with stable segment identifiers and
validated geometries.

## Product characteristics in the Burgwald context

In Burgwald, segmentation is constructed from a canonical S2 predictor stack via
explicit technical steps:

- z-score standardisation of the multi-band stack,
- PCA feature extraction to obtain a compact, de-correlated feature space,
- multi-scale MeanShift segmentation, screened by local perturbation stability
  using ARI_prev,
- explicit postcondition enforcement via size-regime filtering (knee/jump logic)
  to suppress unstable micro-fragments,
- polygonisation after masking, geometry validation, AOI clipping, and
  enforcement of one geometry per segment_id.

The resulting S3 product is a reproducible structural partition (GPKG) with a
persistent segment_id field. Segments are used downstream purely as spatial
supports and control units (aggregation carriers and CV grouping), without
semantic commitments.

## Semantic versus organisational ordering

S3 defines a semantic layer of structural representation, not a strict temporal
stage in the processing pipeline. Some downstream products may depend on S3 for
practical reasons, while some S2 products may operationally be executed after S3
without changing their semantic classification.

The defining criterion is whether a product represents a spatial partition
structure rather than a derived measurement or a semantic descriptor.

Maintaining this distinction prevents circular reasoning between structure,
representation, and decision logic.

---

## Contract statement

S3 comprises the explicit spatial partitioning of continuous spatial data into
reproducible structural units. These units provide stable spatial support for
aggregation, attribution, and downstream modelling, without carrying inherent
semantic meaning or decision logic.
