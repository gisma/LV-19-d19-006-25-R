# S2 — Feature Space

## Purpose
Transform observations into process-relevant descriptors.

Features represent abstractions and proxies of physical processes.

## Typical Inputs
- Harmonised rasters
- Time-series cubes
- Land cover layers

## Typical Outputs
- Terrain derivatives
- Dynamic indicators
- Classification products
- Feature stacks

## Abstraction
Geometry → Process proxies

## Gains
- Interpretability
- Analytical tractability
- Cross-scale comparability

## Losses
- Local detail
- Physical completeness
- Measurement granularity

## Not in Scope
- Spatial segmentation
- Optimisation
- Decision making
