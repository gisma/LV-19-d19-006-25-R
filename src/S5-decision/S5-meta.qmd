# S5: Decision and candidate selection space  
Burgwald decision stack: meta-level description

![](fig/s5.drawio.svg){fig-align="center"}

## Conceptual position of S5

S5 denotes the layer in which descriptive segment representations are transformed
into explicit decisions. Decisions include candidate selection, ranking,
coverage control, and multi-criteria fusion under explicit constraints and
parameters.

The unit of operation remains the segment, but the semantics change: S5
introduces normative logic. Quantities are no longer interpreted as neutral
descriptors but are used to express preferences, representativeness, coverage,
and admissibility.

S5 addresses the following question:

> Given a fixed attribute space on stable segments, which concrete spatial
> candidates should be selected under explicit constraints, objectives, and
> trade-offs?

S5 therefore converts representations into actionable subsets.

## Boundary conditions: what S5 explicitly excludes

S5 does not generate raster predictors or measurement products (S2).  
It does not generate or modify spatial partitions (S3).  
It does not generate new descriptive signatures (S4).  
It does not perform representation learning or embedding (S4L).  
It does not perform validation, benchmarking, or uncertainty analysis (S6).

Any operation that merely computes descriptors without selection semantics
remains outside S5.

## Functional role of S5 in the decision stack

S5 fulfils three coupled roles.

First, it defines admissible design space. Hard filters restrict which segments
are allowed to participate in a decision (e.g. forest-only constraints or domain
subsets).

Second, it structures candidate spaces. Segments are clustered into strata in
multiple domain-specific spaces (information-theoretic, physiographic,
hydrological, biostructural, coverage). Distance to cluster center serves as a
formalised representativeness criterion.

Third, it resolves selection and trade-offs. Candidates are selected per stratum
using lexicographic ranking or weighted multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA).
Optional spatial spacing enforces geometric independence between selected
candidates.

The outputs are explicit candidate sets (segments and representative points)
rather than continuous fields.

## Design principles for S5 processing

All S5 workflows obey the following constraints.

Decision logic is explicit and parameterised. Filters, quotas, ranking modes,
weights, and spacing rules are declared in code and versionable.

Geometry remains immutable. Segment geometry is inherited from upstream layers
and never modified.

Selection semantics are transparent. Distances, scores, and ranking criteria are
materialised as attributes in the output layers.

Productive and exploratory outputs are separated. Scenario exploration may
write temporary artefacts, while promoted products are registered explicitly.

## Product families in the Burgwald context

S5 is implemented as several parallel decision spaces, each producing strata and
candidate outputs.

**Information-theoretic decision space**  
Clusters segments in IT metric space and selects representative segments and
points.

**Physiographic decision space**  
Clusters segments in terrain-derived attribute space and selects representative
candidates.

**Hydrological decision space**  
Clusters segments in flow- and network-related attribute space and selects
representative candidates.

**Biostructural decision space**  
Clusters segments in canopy and structure attribute space and selects
representative candidates.

**Coverage decision space**  
Clusters segments in land-cover fraction space and selects representative
candidates.

**MCDA fusion space**  
Fuses per-domain representativeness distances into a weighted composite score
and selects globally ranked candidates.

**Constraint-based selector**  
Executes declarative scenario settings combining hard filters, coverage targets,
ranking strategy (lexicographic or MCDA), and spatial spacing constraints.

All outputs consist of selected segments and derived representative points.

## Semantic versus organisational ordering

S5 is defined by the presence of explicit selection semantics, not by script
location or execution order. Any workflow that introduces filtering, ranking,
quota enforcement, weighting, or optimisation enters S5 by definition.

Conversely, workflows that only compute descriptive attributes remain in S4,
even if they are executed close to decision scripts.

This separation preserves interpretability and prevents entanglement of
representation and decision logic.

---

## Contract statement

S5 comprises all operations that transform descriptive segment representations
into explicit candidate selections under declared constraints and objectives. It
produces reproducible, parameterised decision artefacts while preserving full
traceability to upstream representations.
