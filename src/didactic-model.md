# Spatial Research Pipeline — Didactic Core Model

This project is not about running scripts.
It is about understanding how spatial knowledge is constructed.

Every step transforms reality into a more abstract representation.
Every transformation introduces assumptions, simplifications and loss of information.

Your task is to reason about these transformations.

## The Five Modelling Spaces

S0 — Problem Space  
What is the question?
Which spatial scale matters?
What would count as a good decision?

S1 — Observation Space  
What can be observed or measured?
Which sensors, archives and datasets define reality?
Which uncertainties enter at this stage?

S2 — Feature Space  
Which variables describe relevant processes?
Which indicators act as proxies?
Which scales and aggregations are introduced?

S3 — Structural Space  
How is space discretised?
Which spatial units, segments or strata exist?
Which patterns become visible or hidden?

S4 — Decision Space  
How are candidates evaluated?
Which trade-offs exist?
Which assumptions dominate the outcome?

S5 — Validation Space  
How stable are the results?
How sensitive are they to parameter changes?
What transfers to other regions or scales?

## Pipeline Logic

Problem
  → Observation
    → Features
      → Structure
        → Decision
          → Validation

Parallel paths are intentional.
Different abstractions produce different truths.

## Core Rules

1. No step is neutral.
2. Every transformation loses information.
3. Multiple representations are necessary.
4. Structure is modelled, not discovered.
5. Decisions are justified, not computed.
6. Reproducibility is mandatory.
7. Interpretation belongs outside the code.

## Typical Failure Modes

- Confusing tools with models.
- Treating features as reality.
- Hiding assumptions inside code.
- Optimising before understanding structure.
- Overfitting spatial detail.
- Ignoring scale effects.

---

## Your Responsibility as Analyst

- Know which modelling space you are working in.
- State your assumptions explicitly.
- Track what is gained and what is lost.
- Question whether your abstraction matches the problem.
- Document reasoning, not only results.

---

## Success Criterion

You succeed when you can explain:
- why a result looks as it does,
- which assumptions created it,
- and how it would change under different abstractions.
