# Run Layer

## Purpose
Provide explicit entry points into the pipeline.

These scripts orchestrate execution order and define standard workflows.

## Typical Usage
- run_S1_all.R → build observation base
- run_S2_all.R → generate features
- run_S3_all.R → derive structure

## Epistemic Status
Execution logic only — no modelling logic.
