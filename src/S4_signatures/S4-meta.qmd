# S4: Deterministic signatures and attribute space  
Burgwald decision stack: meta-level description


![](images/s4.drawio.svg){fig-align="center"}

## Conceptual position of S4

S4 denotes the layer in which fixed spatial structures (segments from S3) are
transformed into a deterministic attribute space. The unit of computation is the
segment. All quantities in S4 are attached to segment geometry and indexed by a
stable segment identifier.

S4 introduces no new spatial structure and no semantic interpretation. It
performs explicit, reproducible aggregation of upstream products in order to
create segment-level descriptors (“signatures”). These signatures remain purely
descriptive and preserve traceability to their originating measurements and
transformations.

S4 addresses a specific question:

> Which properties of a fixed spatial structure can be derived deterministically
> and represented as a stable attribute space, prior to any learning, selection,
> or decision logic?

This restriction is intentional. S4 prepares representations but does not
interpret them.

## Boundary conditions: what S4 explicitly excludes

S4 does not contain raster products or pixel-based predictors (S2).  
It does not create or modify spatial partitions (S3).  
It does not perform representation learning, embedding, or latent modelling
(S4L).  
It does not perform ranking, optimisation, or decision logic (S5).

Any operation that introduces preferences, thresholds motivated by objectives,
candidate selection, or trade-off reasoning is outside the S4 domain.

## Functional role of S4 in the decision stack

S4 fulfils three complementary functions.

First, it provides a stable attribute space. Segment geometry from S3 becomes the
carrier of quantitative descriptors that can be used consistently across
downstream workflows.

Second, it externalises aggregation logic. Instead of implicit neighbourhoods or
ad-hoc summaries, aggregation is expressed explicitly as zonal extraction and
joins, making scale and support effects visible and reproducible.

Third, it enables modular composition of representations. Independent signature
families can be generated and combined without coupling their semantics or
execution order.

In the Burgwald implementation, the main S4 artefact is a unified attribute stack
attached to segment geometry.

## Design principles for S4 processing

All S4 products follow strict constraints.

Inputs and outputs are registry-defined. No paths, layers, or intermediate
artefacts are hard-coded.

Geometry is inherited exclusively from S3. Segment identifiers are persistent
and form the primary key for all joins and validations.

Transformations are explicit and deterministic. Aggregation operators, joins,
and derived quantities are declared in code and produce identical results under
re-execution.

S4 remains descriptive. Any discretisation or encoding is treated as a
representational variant, not as a semantic or decision step.

## Product families in the Burgwald context

Information-theoretic and landscape metrics derive structural descriptors of
composition and configuration at segment level.

Physiographic metrics derive segment attributes from terrain-related predictors
(elevation and derivative fields).

Hydrological metrics derive segment attributes from flow-related and network
products.

Cover metrics derive per-class fractions and composition descriptors from
categorical layers.

Biostructural metrics derive segment attributes from canopy and structure
rasters via zonal extraction.

An integration step joins all partial signature layers into a single attribute
stack attached to the segment geometry. Optional transparent discretisations may
be generated strictly as parallel representations.

All products remain keyed by the same segment identifiers and retain direct
traceability to upstream layers.

---

## Semantic versus organisational ordering

The semantic classification of S4 is independent of execution order. A workflow
remains part of S4 as long as it produces deterministic, segment-level
descriptors without introducing learning or decision logic.

Conversely, any workflow that transforms these descriptors into latent
representations, embeddings, rankings, or selections leaves S4 by definition,
regardless of its position in the processing pipeline.

Maintaining this distinction prevents entanglement of representation,
structure, and decision semantics.

---

## Contract statement

S4 comprises deterministic, auditable signatures attached to fixed spatial
structures. It transforms S3 segments into a stable attribute space via explicit
aggregation and joins, without introducing learning, semantics, or decision
logic. These representations form the quantitative basis for all subsequent
modelling and decision layers.
